# pands-problem-sheet
# Contains submitted coursework for Oisin O S
# helloworld.py is Week 1's assignment, testing github uploads and first program writing
# bank.py is Week 2's assignment, soliciting user input and converting currency to Euro values
# convert.py is Week 3's assignment, which solicits user input of a bank account number and then converts the leading six digits to "X"'s for privacy
# collatz.py is Week 4's assignment, which demonstrates the Collatz conjecture. It takes a number, and if it is even, divdes it by 2. If the number is odd, it triples it and adds 1. The program continues with these instructions until it reaches the number 1.
